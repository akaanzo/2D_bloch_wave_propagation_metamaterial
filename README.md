# Bloch Wave Propagation in a Periodic Metamaterial

<> ## Moved on GitLab [https://gitlab.com/anzo559/2D_bloch_wave_propagation_metamaterial](https://gitlab.com/anzo559/2D_bloch_wave_propagation_metamaterial)

Elastic bloch wave propagation in a 2D periodic metamaterial. Simulations have done with COMSOL Multiphysics (5.6.0) applying Floquet periodic boundary conditions.

Dispersion surfaces have been plotted with both Wolfram Mathematica (version 13.0.0 is needed) and Matlab (R2022a).
